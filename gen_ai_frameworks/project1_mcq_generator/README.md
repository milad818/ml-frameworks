## PROJECT 1 - MCQ Generator

### MCQ (Multiple-Choice Questions)
MCQ stands for Multiple-Choice Questions, which are a type of objective assessment where a question is followed by multiple answer choices, usually including one correct answer and several distractors (incorrect options). MCQs are widely used in exams quizzes, and surveys to test knowledge efficiently.

### MCQ Generator
An MCQ generator is a tool (often AI-powered) that automatically creates multiple-choice questions from a given text, topic, or dataset. These tools use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to extract key concepts, formulate questions, and generate answer choices.

#### Types of MCQ Generators
1. **Rule-based MCQ Generators:** Use predefined templates and patterns to create questions.
2. **AI-based MCQ Generators:** Utilize NLP and deep learning to automatically generate questions from text, documents, or structured data.
3. **Online MCQ Generators:** Web-based tools where users input text, and the system generates MCQs.

#### Common Use Cases
- **Education:** Teachers use them to create quizzes.
- **Recruitment & Assessments:** Used in hiring tests.
- **E-learning Platforms:** Auto-generate practice questions from study materials.
